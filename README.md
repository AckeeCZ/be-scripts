## DEPRECATION NOTICE

</div>

Until further notice this package is depreciated and no longer maintained. Here is a list of reasons and viable alternatives:
- `docs` - due to shift towards [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and [a new docs generator](grpc_tools_node_protoc) and veeery loong installation time of blueprint parser dependency [protagonist](https://github.com/apiaryio/protagonist), be-scripts was removed from projects and remained unused for generating docs.
- `proxie` - use [goproxie](https://github.com/AckeeCZ/goproxie), a Go revitalized version, without needing you to install cloud_sql_proxy
